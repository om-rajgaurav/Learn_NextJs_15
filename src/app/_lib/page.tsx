// Private folders contd.
// Private folders are super useful for a bunch of things:
// - Keeping your Ul logic separate from routing logic
// - Having a consistent way to organize internal files in your project
// - Making it easier to group related files in your code editor
// - Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file naming conventions
// If you actually want an underscore in your URL, use "%5F" instead. That's just the URL-encoded version of an underscore.
